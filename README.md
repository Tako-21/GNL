# GNL

## Description
Whether it's a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you'll always need a way to read the contents line by line. It's time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.

## How to install and run the project
`git clone https://github.com/Tako-21/Gnl.git`

`cd Gnl`

`./run.sh`  Here you will have to put the number call functions and the buffer size.

Enjoy ! You can modify the filetest.txt for your own tests.

Peace ✌️
